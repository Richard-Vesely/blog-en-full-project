*I like this quote:*  
*"Statistically speaking a normal person is:*

- Emotionally anxious and depressed*
- *Socially lonely*
- *Financially in debt*

*FUCK BEING NORMAL"*  
\- Mark Manson

Seriously...  
You are always choosing reasons why (or why not) to do something. It's super important to choose those reasons carefully because how well you choose them determines how your life turns out.

Consider eating a juicy steak and the following two reasons for doing so:

1. You are uncomfortably full and want to distract yourself from the discomfort by eating something tasty.
2. You are terribly hungry, having fasted for a day, and now it's your time to eat.

Same action, different reasons. One reason serves you well; the other doesn't.

It's not about "not doing actions that are normal" or "doing actions that aren't normal," but about not using "normal" as a reason to (not) do anything. It's a poor reason.
