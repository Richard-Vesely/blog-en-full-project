Here are three questions that determine most of your happiness in life:  
1. What am I working on and why?
2. Who am I spending time with and why?
3. How well am I treating my body and why?  

--------------

These are great questions for reflection. But I find it helpful to ask more immediate questions. Questions about: *Why I am doing whatever I am doing right now?*  
###### **Work**
- Am I doing this because it brings joy to my life?
- Am I doing this because it pays the checks? 
- Am I doing this to make someone else proud? To prove myself worthy? To be normal? 
- Or am I doing it because I woke up this morning craving to do it?

###### **Relationships**
- Does this make my relationships more profound? 
- Am I just trying to fit in? 
- Am I motivated by fear or by love?

###### **Health**  
- Is eating this making me more healthy, or is it just pleasure?
- Am I (not) doing this because it's making me more healthy, or because I just feel like it?
